# Parametric Radius (and Thickness) Gauge
This is a simple guage that has both concave and convex corner radius. Optionally, it can also be used as a thickness gauge, although the SCAD file defaults to a thickness of 1.5 (mm). The default file is designed for a range of 1-30mm with an overall width and height of each guage at 65x35mm. However, this can be adjusted very easily.

There are also a couple of handy scripts provided for generating rendered objects (3mf & STL files). These are Python scripts that use the OpenSCAD command line utility, so of course both are a prerequisite for using these scripts.

In addition there is a paramatric box to accompany your guages. The SCAD file has parameters to easily adjust for how many and what size, but the provided 3mf and STL files are a match for the 30 provided gauge files. 

# License?
There is no license. There are no restrictions. I don't care what you do with these files. I don't care if modify them and claim them as your own. I don't care if you make money with them. I don't care if you think they are stupid. Literally do whatever you want with them.
